Most roadmaps include hundreds of things to learn which is just not possible for anyone which is why I created my own roadmap. Instead of listing out every possible thing you can learn I only list the things that are most important to learn. I also include links to countless tutorials, videos, and articles covering nearly every topic you need to learn to become a developer in 2021.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf0e Find Me Here:\n\nMy Blog: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com\nMy Courses: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/WebDevSimplified\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f Timestamps:\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:21 - IMPORTANT: Free Roadmap\n01:14 - Frontend Start - HTML\n02:09 - CSS\n03:11 - JavaScript\n05:42 - Frontend Frameworks\n07:19 - Backend\n08:28 - Backend Framework\n10:18 - Important Backend Concepts\n11:21 - Databases\n12:34 - Backend And Frontend Concepts\n13:51 - Things To Watch For In 2021\n\n\n#WebDev2021 #WDS #WebDevRoadmap"

                "description": "\ud83d\udea8 IMPORTANT:\n\nGet Your .Tech Domain Now: https://go.tech/wds\n\nSoftware job interviews are broken. There is far too much reliance on memorizing dumb algorithmic questions and not nearly enough emphasis put on testing actual software development skills. There is a reason for this problem, though.

In this video we are designing the landing page of an imaginary Web Dev Simplified bootcamp. In this video I explain my exact thought process when designing a web page in order to entice and convert customers.

I even used three of the five projects on this list to land my first job and I was told countless times that the reason I received job offers and interviews at many companies was because of the projects on my resume. The best part is any of these projects can be built in a single week so you can start applying and landing jobs sooner.\n\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Concepts Covered:\n\n- What companies are looking for in resumes\n- Which projects are the best for getting hired\n- What skills you need to get hired\n- How to build projects that will get you hired\n\n\n\ud83c\udf0e Find Me Here:\n\nMy Blog: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com\nMy Courses: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/WebDevSimplified\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#WebDevProjects #WDS #JavaScript"

One way that you can quickly improve your code and start writing well designed code now is to implement the interface segregation principle. This principle is part of the SOLID design principles and is, in my opinion, the easiest rule of SOLID for to understand and implement. \n\nThe main idea of the interface segregation principle is that any class that implements an interface must use all functions/properties of the interface.

This means that any class that inherits from another class needs to use all of the methods/properties from the base class.

Memoization is just the act of caching values so that they can be calculated quicker in the future. Memoization is really useful in all parts of programming, but where it is most useful is in dynamic programming. In this video I will explain what memoization is, how to use it, and why it is so useful especially in dynamic programming.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcda Materials/References:\n\nRecursion Tutorial: https://youtu.be/6oDQaB2one8\n\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Concepts Covered:\n\n- What memoization is\n- When you should use memoization\n- How to use memoization\n- What dynamic programming is\n- How to use memoization in dynamic programming\n\n\n\ud83c\udf0e Find Me Here:\n\nMy Blog: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com\nMy Courses: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/WebDevSimplified\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#Memoization #WDS #DynamicProgramming"

In this video I will be covering absolutely everything you need to know about user login and authentication in the most concise and simple way. We will be using Express for our server backend and Passport to help us manage the logged in state of users. We will also be sure to properly encrypt and hash all user passwords so that our application is completely secure.

In this video I will be breaking down the basic Object Oriented Programming terms, Class, Object, Instance, Instantiate, and Constructor. By the end of this video you will have a complete understanding of how Classes, Objects, and Constructors interact and relate to one another.\n\nClass: Similar to a blueprint. It defines what its objects will look like (functions, parameters, etc.)\nObject: Similar to a house produced from a blueprint. It is an instance of a class and contains all the specific details of the class that are not shared with any of the other objects, such as the color for a house.\nConstructor: This is the method that is called when creating an object from a class. It is usually used to set all of the specific details of the object such as color in the house example.\nNew: The new keyword is used before a class name to create an object using the class constructor.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Concepts Covered:\n\n- What are classes\n- What are objects\n- Objects vs Classes\n- How to create objects\n- How to create classes\n- What are constructors\n\n\n\ud83c\udf0e Find Me Here:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#ClassVsObject #OOP #Constructor",

In this video I will be breaking down the basic Object Oriented Programming terms, Class, Object, Instance, Instantiate, and Constructor. By the end of this video you will have a complete understanding of how Classes, Objects, and Constructors interact and relate to one another.\n\nClass: Similar to a blueprint. It defines what its objects will look like (functions, parameters, etc.)\nObject: Similar to a house produced from a blueprint. It is an instance of a class and contains all the specific details of the class that are not shared with any of the other objects, such as the color for a house.\nConstructor: This is the method that is called when creating an object from a class. It is usually used to set all of the specific details of the object such as color in the house example.\nNew: The new keyword is used before a class name to create an object using the class constructor.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Concepts Covered:\n\n- What are classes\n- What are objects\n- Objects vs Classes\n- How to create objects\n- How to create classes\n- What are constructors\n\n\n\ud83c\udf0e Find Me Here:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#ClassVsObject #OOP #Constructor"

                "description": "MVC is the most popular architecture for building complex web servers. It is used by many frameworks, and implemented into nearly every modern web application. In this video I will cover what MVC is, how it works, and why you should use it.\n\nMVC stands for Model, View, Controller. It is used to define how these three different entities can interact with each other.\n\nThe Controller handles user requests and delegates information between the Model and the View. It only deals with requests, and never handles data or presentation.\n\nThe Model handles data validation, logic, and persistence. It interacts directly with the database to handle the data.

                "description": "If you have used any modern website, then chances are you have interacted with a website that uses REST. Even YouTube uses RESTful URLs on its site, but what exactly is REST? For starters, REST stands for Representation State Transfer and is just a fancy way of saying that a server responds to create, read, update, and delete requests in a standard way. The idea behind REST is to treat all server URLs as access points for the various resources on the server. For example in this URL, http://example.com/users, users represents the resource that the server is exposing. As mentioned earlier, REST needs a way to create, read, update, and delete these resources and it does so with the following five URLs.\nhttp://example.com/users\nhttp://example.com/users\nhttp://example.com/users/1\nhttp://example.com/users/1\nhttp://example.com/users/1\n\nThe first two URLs do not have an ID so they act on the entire user's resource, while the last three URLs do have an ID in their URL and thus act on only a single user resource, but as you may notice there are only two distinct URLs. That is because REST uses the four basic HTTP actions, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to determine what to do with each URL. If we add in those actions to the URLs it is much easier to see what each of the URLs do.\n[GET]     http://example.com/users\n[POST]    http://example.com/users\n[GET]     http://example.com/users/1\n[PUT]     http://example.com/users/1\n[DELETE]  http://example.com/users/1\n\nThe first URL we have is the GET users URL, and it is used to get a list of all users. In REST when a GET URL does not have an ID it acts upon the entire resource and will always return a list of every item in that resource. The GET action in REST corresponds with reading data.\n\nThe second URL, which is almost identical to the first, is used to create a new user. In REST the POST action corresponds with creation, and should always be used on the entire resource by not using an ID in the URL.\n\nThe third URL is another GET URL, but this URL is for getting only a single user based on the id that is in the URL. The ID portion of the URL is used by REST to determine which resource from the collection of resources it should act upon. In the case of this URL it is used to return the user with that ID.\n\nThe fourth URL is the most confusing of them all, but it is used to update a user with the given ID. The PUT action in REST corresponds with update and works very similarly to POST, but instead of creating a new resource it updates an existing resource.\n\nLastly, we have the most straight forward URL of them all which is for deleting a user with a specific ID. The DELETE action in REST does exactly what you would think and deletes the resource with the given ID.\n\n\nIn order for a website to use REST, the URLs do not need to be formatted exactly the same as above. For example using these URLs would still be considered RESTful, but most applications will use the previously mentioned URLs.\n[GET]     http://example.com/users\n[POST]    http://example.com/users\n[GET]     http://example.com/users/details/1\n[PUT]     http://example.com/users/update/1\n[DELETE]  http://example.com/users/delete/1\n\nThe only thing that matters with REST is that the URLs used represent a resource, in this case a user, and that they support creating, reading, updating, and deleting from that resource using the HTTP actions GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n\nPrevious Video:\nhttps://youtu.be/4r6WdaY3SOA\n\nNext Video:\nhttps://youtu.be/DUg2SWWK18I\n\nPlaylist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8jbFkBjOuFjhxANC63OmXM\n\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\n\nCodePen:\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#REST #WebDevelopment #RESTful",

                "title": "How The Backend Works",
                "description": "As we already know, the web is made up of two main parts. The frontend and the backend. The frontend is concerned with presentation and is fairly easy to understand since it is what we interact with daily on the web. The backend, on the other hand, is all of the parts of the web that users do not directly interact with. In this video we are going to discuss the basics of how the backend of a website works by tracing all of the steps that the backend must go through from the moment it receives a request to the point it sends a response back to the client.\n\nStarting at the beginning the server will receive a request from a client in the form of a URL. From this URL the server can get almost all of the information it needs in order to process a request. Let's break apart a typical URL. At the beginning we have the protocol for the request. The only thing that the protocol does is tell the server if the request is encrypted. HTTP is for standard non-encrypted requests, and HTTPS is for encrypted requests. Other than telling the server if the response is encrypted or not the protocol doesn't affect the way the server handles requests and can be ignored. Next, we have the host, also known as the domain name. Again, this is not important to worry about for the server since all it does is tell the internet which server to send the response to. Each server has their own particular host, so once the request actually gets to the server the host does not matter since all requests for the server will have the same host. For example, youtube.com is the host for the YouTube server, so the YouTube server already knows that all requests it gets will have the host youtube.com. This means that we can safely ignore the first half of the URL which leaves us with the last two sections of the URL. The path and the query string. The path tells the server what the client wants and defines which section of code on the server should be run in order to get the correct response. Essentially the server is broken down into a bunch of different sections which all correspond to a specific path. Lastly the query string is used by the specific section of the server to alter the response. The query string is broken down into specific query parameters which can augment the way that the server responds to a request for a specific path. For example YouTube uses the same path when you search for a video, but the query string contains a search_query parameter which tells the server what you searched for so it can respond with what you want.\n\nThe URL alone is not enough to tell the server exactly what it needs to do, though. It can tell the server which section to look for and how to alter that section based on the query parameters, but that section of the server is broken down even further into multiple different parts. To determine which part of that section the server should run it needs to use an action which is passed along with the URL. This action can either be GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. By combining the action and the path the server can find the correct part of the correct section that it needs to run. It can then use the query parameters to alter the response of that particular part and section.\n\nNormally the response from the server will be an HTML page that is dynamically generated based on the request from the client. This is why when you go to the YouTube search page it always shows you the same page, since it has the same path and action, but the videos that are returned from your search are different based on the query parameter for your search.\n\nAnother important thing to note about a server is that it is only accessible to the outside world through the sections that it defines. This means that you can store any secure information on the server and it will be safe as long as it is not exposed through a specific path. This is why it is safe to have a database and website running on the same server since the server only chooses to expose the website and not the database. Essentially the server acts as a barrier between the outside world and all the parts of a website.\n\nNext Video:\nhttps://youtu.be/6sUbt-Qp6Pg\n\nPlaylist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8jbFkBjOuFjhxANC63OmXM\n\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\n\nCodePen:\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#Backend #WebDevelopment #Programming",

                    "title": "How The Backend Works",
                    "description": "As we already know, the web is made up of two main parts. The frontend and the backend. The frontend is concerned with presentation and is fairly easy to understand since it is what we interact with daily on the web. The backend, on the other hand, is all of the parts of the web that users do not directly interact with. In this video we are going to discuss the basics of how the backend of a website works by tracing all of the steps that the backend must go through from the moment it receives a request to the point it sends a response back to the client.\n\nStarting at the beginning the server will receive a request from a client in the form of a URL. From this URL the server can get almost all of the information it needs in order to process a request. Let's break apart a typical URL. At the beginning we have the protocol for the request. The only thing that the protocol does is tell the server if the request is encrypted. HTTP is for standard non-encrypted requests, and HTTPS is for encrypted requests. Other than telling the server if the response is encrypted or not the protocol doesn't affect the way the server handles requests and can be ignored. Next, we have the host, also known as the domain name. Again, this is not important to worry about for the server since all it does is tell the internet which server to send the response to. Each server has their own particular host, so once the request actually gets to the server the host does not matter since all requests for the server will have the same host. For example, youtube.com is the host for the YouTube server, so the YouTube server already knows that all requests it gets will have the host youtube.com. This means that we can safely ignore the first half of the URL which leaves us with the last two sections of the URL. The path and the query string. The path tells the server what the client wants and defines which section of code on the server should be run in order to get the correct response. Essentially the server is broken down into a bunch of different sections which all correspond to a specific path. Lastly the query string is used by the specific section of the server to alter the response. The query string is broken down into specific query parameters which can augment the way that the server responds to a request for a specific path. For example YouTube uses the same path when you search for a video, but the query string contains a search_query parameter which tells the server what you searched for so it can respond with what you want.\n\nThe URL alone is not enough to tell the server exactly what it needs to do, though. It can tell the server which section to look for and how to alter that section based on the query parameters, but that section of the server is broken down even further into multiple different parts. To determine which part of that section the server should run it needs to use an action which is passed along with the URL. This action can either be GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. By combining the action and the path the server can find the correct part of the correct section that it needs to run. It can then use the query parameters to alter the response of that particular part and section.\n\nNormally the response from the server will be an HTML page that is dynamically generated based on the request from the client. This is why when you go to the YouTube search page it always shows you the same page, since it has the same path and action, but the videos that are returned from your search are different based on the query parameter for your search.\n\nAnother important thing to note about a server is that it is only accessible to the outside world through the sections that it defines. This means that you can store any secure information on the server and it will be safe as long as it is not exposed through a specific path. This is why it is safe to have a database and website running on the same server since the server only chooses to expose the website and not the database. Essentially the server acts as a barrier between the outside world and all the parts of a website.\n\nNext Video:\nhttps://youtu.be/6sUbt-Qp6Pg\n\nPlaylist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8jbFkBjOuFjhxANC63OmXM\n\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\n\nCodePen:\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#Backend #WebDevelopment #Programming"

The only problem is that the boilerplate setup can be tedious when working with multiple fonts. That is where the site Transfonter.org comes in.

Pre-processors like SASS and LESS were used to solve this problem, but now CSS has its own variable system! In this video I will be breaking down exactly how CSS variables work. We will be covering their syntax, use cases, and how to use them in JavaScript. In the end of this video we will have a fully functioning, albeit ugly, website with theme swapping buttons.\n\nView The Code:\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified/pen/wNyobw\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\n\nCodePen:\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#CSSVariables #CSS #WebDevelopment",

Pre-processors like SASS and LESS were used to solve this problem, but now CSS has its own variable system! In this video I will be breaking down exactly how CSS variables work. We will be covering their syntax, use cases, and how to use them in JavaScript. In the end of this video we will have a fully functioning, albeit ugly, website with theme swapping buttons.\n\nView The Code:\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified/pen/wNyobw\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\n\nCodePen:\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#CSSVariables #CSS #WebDevelopment"

                "description": "Unlike many programming languages JavaScript has both a double equals (==) and a triple equals (===) equality operator. For the most part these two operators work exactly the same, but the double equals operator converts the types of the objects being compared to the same type. This sounds like a good thing at first, but it can cause some strange bugs to occur when comparing certain objects/types. Because of this the triple equals operator should almost always be used, except in the case of checking if an object is null or undefined.\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\n\nCodePen:\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#JavaScript #WebDevelopment #Programming",

                    "description": "Unlike many programming languages JavaScript has both a double equals (==) and a triple equals (===) equality operator. For the most part these two operators work exactly the same, but the double equals operator converts the types of the objects being compared to the same type. This sounds like a good thing at first, but it can cause some strange bugs to occur when comparing certain objects/types. Because of this the triple equals operator should almost always be used, except in the case of checking if an object is null or undefined.\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\n\nCodePen:\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#JavaScript #WebDevelopment #Programming"

This pattern is all about handling the null keyword in a way that removes all of those nasty if (object == null) checks from your code.

It also makes handling default values for null objects a breeze.\nIf you want to learn more about the Null Object Pattern make sure to checkout the repository linked below.\n\n\nDesign Pattern Playlist:\nhttp://bit.ly/2QrGnDq\n\nDesign Pattern Repository:\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Design-Patterns\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\n\nCodePen:\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#DesignPatterns #CleanCode #Programming"

There are many different forms of cross site scripting, but the most common cause of cross site scripting is using the JavaScript method innerHTML with user input. Any form of user input must be escaped before being used with innerHTML, and any use of innerHTML should be thoroughly thought out to ensure no user input can make it through without being sanitized.
